# City Temperature Management API

## Introduction
This project is an asyncAPI service for city temperature management written in FastAPI.

## Features
* CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for managing city data. This is a simple API that allows you to create, read, update, and delete cities. The logic for managing cities and temperature data is split between endpoints and crud functions.
* Fetching current temperature data for all cities in the database.
* Filtering temperature data by city ID. The API stores temperature data in the database creating a history of all temperature data for each city. This allows to retrieve the history of temperature data for a specific city.
